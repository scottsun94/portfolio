With the knowledge in psychology, I took the task of further secondary research on this topic, We were astonished at the statistics of how seriously teenagers have suffered from mental health problems shown on the picture on the right.</p>
						<p class = "description-1 divide-1">The good news is that some psychological research has discovered the positive effect of love on mental health. Trauppman et al. (1981) conducted a study exploring the effects of intimacy on mental and physical health. The results showed that those who were happier and more satisfied in their relationships showed lower levels of depression, anxiety and self-consciousness.</p>

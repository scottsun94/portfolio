                                This project was the class project for Psychological Research Methods in Georgia Tech. The general topic we received was to improve the user experience in the retail business. Our team picked gaming mice as the product we would focus on. Then we started to design and conduct research to explore this field.</p>

                              <p class="project-desc">Informed by our divergent and convergent research processes, <span style="font-weight: 600;">we want to solve the problem of how to improve the buying experience of gaming mice in BestBuy's brick and mortar stores through omnichannel experience design. We wanted to help our target users who stuggled with:<br>
                                - Poor selection of gaming mice and lack of related information in brick and mortar stores.<br>
                                - Lack of interaction with the mice in the display area and being unable to test them in real games.

                              <p class="project-desc">1.In the divergent research part, we split the work and contribute to all the research almost equally. We did the field observation together. I finished the online walkthrough and decomposition of Logitech's website. I also helped with the distribution of survey and completed two interviews.<br>
                                2.In the convergent research part, I conducted contextual inquiry and helped with the distribution of survey. I also created the user journeys.<br>
                              3.In the design iteration, we worked together in the ideation, sketch and wireframe phases. When it came to prototype, I finished more than half of the hifi screens. After the project was over, I completed another iteration based on the feedback from users. I also contributed a lot to the cognitive walkthrough and benchmarking test both as the facilitator and the notetaker.</p>

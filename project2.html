                              <p class="project-desc">1.In the divergent research part, we split the work and contribute to all the research almost equally.<br>
                                2.In the convergent research part, I mainly worked on the distribution of survey, execution of contextual inquiry. I also created the user journeys.<br>
                              3.In the design iteration, we worked together in the ideation, sketch and wireframe phases. When it came to prototype, I finished more than half of the hifi screens. After the project was over, I completed another iteration based on the feedback from users. I also contributed a lot to the cognitive walkthrough and benchmarking test both facilitators and notetakers.</p>

                                <b>1.User Research:</b><br>
                               - Firstly, we collected and aggregated feedback from iOS stores, students, student club leaders. We also analyzed the data on Apple's App Analytics.<br>
                               - We conducted semi-structured interviews with our classmates and friends and probed to understand what they expected from this app.<br>
                               - Then, we did competitive analysis and learnt from similar apps on the market<br>
                               - Fianlly, we aggregated all the notes and used spreadsheets to analyze them to get the findings. And we created personas and formed user requirements for the following design iterations.<br>
                               <br>

                               
                               <b>2.Desgin Iterations:</b><br>
                               - We started from the allocation of functions based on users' needs. Then we redesigned the information architecture according to the functions we decided to keep.<br>
                               - Then we explored the basic layout of the home screen and put forward different ideas. We evaluated them and picked one direction as a reference for the following design of wireframes and user flow of the whole app.<br>
                               - We created the wireframes and the basic user flow. We conducted internal reviews and tweaked them based on team members' feedback.<br>
                               <br>
                               - Next, we zoomed in on the hifi prototypes and finished one more round of iteration according to internal feedback.<br>
                               - Finally, we completed all the design of screens and user flow.<br>
                               - Unfortunately, due to the limit of time and skills we have, we didn't conduct usability tests in this project. We should have done some benchmarking tests to evaluate the usability or accessibility of our app and had one more iteration.<br>
                               <br>

                               <b>3.Development:</b><br>
                               - We export all the assets and specs and collaborated with iOS developers to actualize the design as accurate as possible.<br>
                               - After the devlopment, we shipped it to the iOS store in April 2017. We also carried out promotion within the university and introduced the new version of Tong Qu.<br>
                               - Finally, we used quantative from App Analytics and qualitative data from iOS store reviews to evaluate the impact of this update.

We recurited 5 experts who had experience in UX research to walkthrough our prototype, finish task and give feedback.

It was important to get users from our intended user group, i.e. student gamers and casual gamers in the corporate, to try it out and see if they found it usable. We recruited 5 participants from both schools and corporates who were gamers to help us evaluate the prototype. Usability benchmarking allowed us to collect both qualitative and quantative data to evaluate and improve our prototype.</p>

I finished the online walkthrough and decomposition of Logitech's website. I also helped with the distribution of survey and completed two interviews.<br>
                                2.In the convergent research part, I conducted contextual inquiry and helped with the distribution of survey. I also created the user journeys.<br>
                              3.In the design iteration, we worked together in the ideation, sketch and wireframe phases. When it came to prototype, I finished more than half of the hifi screens. After the project was over, I completed another iteration based on the feedback from users. I also contributed a lot to the cognitive walkthrough and benchmarking test both as the facilitator and the notetaker.</p>

With the knowledge in psychology, I took the task of further secondary research on this topic, We were astonished at the statistics of how seriously teenagers have suffered from mental health problems shown on the picture on the right.</p>
						<p class = "description-1 divide-1">The good news is that some psychological research has discovered the positive effect of love on mental health. Trauppman et al. (1981) conducted a study exploring the effects of intimacy on mental and physical health. The results showed that those who were happier and more satisfied in their relationships showed lower levels of depression, anxiety and self-consciousness.</p>

						<p class = "description-1">Magic of Love is a game intended to help children learn and practice love in a fun way. Using the natural language processing and hand tracking, it can interact with children in multiple ways, which makes the fairy tale more interactive and interesting. With different senses involved in the process,  children’s physical and mental developments both benefit from it.</p>
						<p class = "description-1 divide-1">The game is set in a magic world where the player is a sorcerer’s apprentice. The player learns about four kinds of magic of love and uses one of them by voice and gesture according to the contexts of the conversations. Different choices will lead to different outcomes of the story. Faced with the different endings, children will understand that love is not that simple and harvest their own experiences with it. Besides, this kind of fairy tale doesn’t just tell a single story, but involves the readers in the development of the story and let them “write” their own stories, which is the key innovation of the game.</p>

With this platform, the whole university community has become more vigorous, active and diverse.<br>

Then I took part in the analysis of our data, distilled the user requirements from the findings and came up with the personas.<br>
                                2.I led the discussion of allocating functions and adjusting information architecture in our team. I designed most of the lofi and hifi prototypes.<br>
                              3.Upon finishing the design work, I collaborated with iOS developer Ruiyang Wang to actualize the design and launched it to the iOS store. I also assisted product manager Xiaofan Lu carry out the app promotion by designing introduction page for the app on Tong Qu's website.</p>

                                <b>1.User Research:</b><br>
                               - Firstly, we collected and aggregated feedback from iOS stores, students, student club leaders. We also analyzed the data on Apple's App Analytics.<br>
                               - We conducted semi-structured interviews with our classmates and friends and probed to understand what they expected from this app.<br>
                               - Then, we did competitive analysis and learnt from similar apps on the market<br>
                               - Fianlly, we aggregated all the notes and used spreadsheets to analyze them to get the findings. And we created personas and formed user requirements for the following design iterations.<br>
                               <br>

                               
                               <b>2.Desgin Iterations:</b><br>
                               - We started from the allocation of functions based on users' needs. Then we redesigned the information architecture according to the functions we decided to keep.<br>
                               - Then we explored the basic layout of the home screen and put forward different ideas. We evaluated them and picked one direction as a reference for the following design of wireframes and user flow of the whole app.<br>
                               - We created the wireframes and the basic user flow. We conducted internal reviews and tweaked them based on team members' feedback.<br>
                               <br>
                               - Next, we zoomed in on the hifi prototypes and finished one more round of iteration according to internal feedback.<br>
                               - Finally, we completed all the design of screens and user flow.<br>
                               - Unfortunately, due to the limit of time and skills we have, we didn't conduct usability tests in this project. We should have done some benchmarking tests to evaluate the usability or accessibility of our app and had one more iteration.<br>
                               <br>

                               <b>3.Development:</b><br>
                               - We export all the assets and specs and collaborated with iOS developers to actualize the design as accurate as possible.<br>
                               - After the devlopment, we shipped it to the iOS store in April 2017. We also carried out promotion within the university and introduced the new version of Tong Qu.<br>
                               - Finally, we used quantative from App Analytics and qualitative data from iOS store reviews to evaluate the impact of this update.

                          <p class = "project-desc"><span style="font-weight: 600">- The usage data showed that students thought of Tong Qu like a tool which helped them enrich their campus life. When the breaks began, they barely used this app.<br>

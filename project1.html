                              <p class="project-desc">1. In the formative research phase, I took part in the in-store observation, task analysis, survey design and semi-structured interviews. I conducted competitive analysis independently. Then I worked with teammates to analyze our data and distilled the user requirements from our findings.<br>
                                2. I actively contributed in the ideation, sketch and wireframe phases. The information architecture and general user flow were revised and finalized by me. I created the overall visual style of the prototype and designed more than half of the hifi screens in several iterations. Yuyan Duan and I completed another iteration to improve the prototype after the project was over.<br>
                              3. In terms of evaluation, I mainly contributed to the feedback sessions for wireframes and prototype. I worked as facilitator and notetaker.</p>

We observed the spatial layout of the store, the shelves for all the furniture or related products and how users interacted with the environment. This method could help us discover some existing pain points or space to improve in brick and mortar stores.

                          - The Home Depot's business was not focused on our target users. They focused more on contractors, builders, interior desingers and DIY customers who have big houses rather than small apartments.<br>
                          - Delivery was inconvenient, especially for people who didn't have cars. Delivery services were quite expensive.<br>
                          - Returns were inevitable now because users wouldn't know how items fit into their homes until they brought them back.<br>
                          - People enjoy seeing and touching furniture by themselves to be confident in their purchase.<br>
                          - Though Ikea's self-pickup system is complete, some people still get confused and need help from staff.</span></p>

We conducted 4 semi-structured interviews with our target users to ask about their furnishing and purchase experiences.

                          <p class = "project-desc"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Some important insights we found through the interviews included:<br>
                          - Measuring the dimensions of apartments was unfamiliar to users and may lead to anxiety and frustration.<br>
                          - Making furnishing plans, especially creating one with a unified visual style, was hard to users if they hadn't received any design, art or related training before.<br>
                          - When users started to work, their time is limited for doing research on the furnishing. So they had to finish this process in a limited amount of time to settle themselves down.</span></p>

For example, there were too many solutions for solving the problem of transporting furniture, whether innovative or conservative, indicating that it was not very promising for us to make more efforts for this problem.</span></p>

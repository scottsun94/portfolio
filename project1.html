I also conducted competitive analysis. Then I worked with teammates to analyze our data and distilled the user requirements from our findings.<br>
                                2. I actively contributed in the ideation, sketch and wireframe phases. I decided on the overall visual style of the prototype and designed more than half of the hifi screens in several iterations. Yuyan Duan and I completed another iteration to make the prototype better designed after the project was over.<br>
                              3. In terms of evaluation, I mainly contributed to the feedback sessions for wireframes and prototype.</p>

                                <b>1.User Research:</b><br>
                               - Firstly, we collected and aggregated feedback from iOS stores, students, student club leaders. We also analyzed the data on Apple's App Analytics.<br>
                               - We conducted semi-structured interviews with our classmates and friends and probed to understand what they expected from this app.<br>
                               - Then, we did competitive analysis and learnt from similar apps on the market<br>
                               - Fianlly, we aggregated all the notes and used spreadsheets to analyze them to get the findings. And we created personas and formed user requirements for the following design iterations.<br>
                               <br>

                               
                               <b>2.Desgin Iterations:</b><br>
                               - We started from the allocation of functions based on users' needs. Then we redesigned the information architecture according to the functions we decided to keep.<br>
                               - Then we explored the basic layout of the home screen and put forward different ideas. We evaluated them and picked one direction as a reference for the following design of wireframes and user flow of the whole app.<br>
                               - We created the wireframes and the basic user flow. We conducted internal reviews and tweaked them based on team members' feedback.<br>
                               <br>
                               - Next, we zoomed in on the hifi prototypes and finished one more round of iteration according to internal feedback.<br>
                               - Finally, we completed all the design of screens and user flow.<br>
                               - Unfortunately, due to the limit of time and skills we have, we didn't conduct usability tests in this project. We should have done some benchmarking tests to evaluate the usability or accessibility of our app and had one more iteration.<br>
                               <br>

                               <b>3.Development:</b><br>
                               - We export all the assets and specs and collaborated with iOS developers to actualize the design as accurate as possible.<br>
                               - After the devlopment, we shipped it to the iOS store in April 2017. We also carried out promotion within the university and introduced the new version of Tong Qu.<br>
                               - Finally, we used quantative from App Analytics and qualitative data from iOS store reviews to evaluate the impact of this update.

                          <p class = "project-desc"><span style="font-weight: 600">IDEA 1 - AI Planner</span> <br></p>
                          <p class = "project-desc">AI Planner stemmed from people’s needs to effortlessly furnish the apartment with a pre-prepared whole set of furniture. Thus, <span style="color:#00AAA8">AI Planner gives the user quick furniture/layout recommendation based on the apartment floor plan that user draws.</span> It allows the user to set their own budget, customize their own furnishing needs, view their apartment floor plan and layout recommendations in both a 2D and 3D views, and get spot-on layout recommendations in no time. Users could place their orders and get all the furniture inside the app. Thus, AI Planner provides quick and effortless room furnishing to users with high level of customization. The key challenges to this idea is to acquire user’s apartment floor plan as well as the ways of presenting the furniture on the app. </p>

                          <p class = "project-desc"><span style="font-weight: 600">IDEA 2 - Furniture Remains</span> <br></p>
                          <p class = "project-desc">The idea of furniture remains is inspired by the fact that apartment residents usually have mobility - thus, old residents have to get rid of their furniture from time to time. And what is more convenient than selling old furniture to new residents? Thus, <span style="color:#00AAA8">Furniture Remains aims to build a communication bridge between the apartment old lessees and new lessees and make the apartment furniture transferred to new hands while staying exactly where they are.</span> Such design removes the placement burden on the new lessee as it allows them to rent an apartment along with a whole set of fitting-floor-plan furniture, and also removes all delivery and transportation trouble for both parties. This idea eliminates user’s whole troublesome experience of measuring floor plan, going to the store, and purchasing furniture, as the new lessee can check out the furniture along the apartment and purchase of the whole set of furniture can be done instantly. One challenge of this app can be that the app has to collaborate with apartment, and therefore may have little user base at first.</p>

                          <p class = "project-desc"><span style="font-weight: 600">IDEA 3 - Roomba with Measurements</span> <br></p>
                          <p class = "project-desc"><span style="color:#00AAA8">The Roomba solution helps users take the measurements of rooms while doing the normal cleaning and sends them to a smartphone app.</span> Adding a lighting and color sensor also allows the Roomba to construct a basic lighting simulation for the user when creating digital 3D models of their rooms. More importantly, we designed the Roomba to be linked with mobile applications that receive the room measurements directly from it. We think that combining digital measurements with layout recommendations and furniture purchase(Idea 1) could have huge potential. However, the feasibility of this single idea can be slim to us at this time since it's more about the development of Roomba which is out of our problem space.</p>

                          <p class = "project-desc"><span style="color:#00AAA8">3D Planning Gamified allows the user to create a 3D rendering of their rooms in a more gamified context with tutorials to help teach the user furnishing strategies.</span> They may select furnishings available in their area to place in the 3D view of their apartment to get a more accurate view of the floor plan and apartment furnishing status. The highlights of this idea is that it attempts to make the usual strenuous and tedious furnishing experience a game and thus deliver a more entertaining, gamified experience to users. By allowing the user to choose, place and rearrange furniture in their simulated view of apartment, this solution easily solves the furniture placement, aesthetics and apartment pre-planning issues and provides the user with instant purchase. The biggest challenge of this solution is that 3D planning on a mobile platform can be too small for the users to see and operate on details. Our skillsets are also inadequate to support ourselves to create a high-quality 3D gamified design in a limited amount of time. </p>

                            As can be seen, <span style="color:#00AAA8">apartment remain and AI Planner are the two ideas that received wide acceptance and least objection.</span> We then conducted a SWOT analysis to compare the four ideas and reached the agreement of keeping AI Planner as the solution to continue.<br>
                          As the result shows, <span style="color:#00AAA8">AI Planning is very innovative for integrating cutting-edge AI technology with a traditional furnishing process and also has great potential in terms of its compatibleness with other ideas. Thus, we finally decided to go with AI Planning.</span>

<!--                         <p class = "project-desc">We Initially had users draw out their own floor plan in two ways: free form draw (click to create dots so to connect the lines) and fill form (swipe through the screens to create colored squares to draw the room contour). <span style="color:#E0334D">According to our user feedback, although users learned how to draw rooms in the feedback session, there was a steep learning curve for both users.

                          <span style="color:#E0334D">- It shows different rooms in different color borders, which was not immediately obvious to the user.
                          - It asks the user to confirm the rooms one by one, which was hard to see and boring. 
                          - If the app recognize a room wrong, there is again the issue of difficulty drawing a room from the user’s end (especially the one with irregular shape).
                          - It asks the user to manually check with doors and windows, and the buttons are too small to click on a mobile screen.

                          With all the user feedback, we decided that leave the job of confirming and altering floor plan to the user comproised usability to a great extent. Thus, we did research and found that the room recognition precision can go above 95%. Thus, we leave the room, doors and windows recognition to the app completely, show the rooms in different color areas to be distinguished easily, and allow the user to tap on each room to confirm details and change the room names. If the recognition is incorrect, we simply tell the user to send their floor plan picture to us for later fix.

                              <p class="project-desc">1. In the formative research phase, I took part in the in-store observation, task analysis, survey design and semi-structured interviews. I conducted competitive analysis independently. Then I worked with teammates to analyze our data and distilled the user requirements from our findings.<br>
                                2. I actively contributed in the ideation, sketch and wireframe phases. I created the overall visual style of the prototype and designed more than half of the hifi screens in several iterations. Yuyan Duan and I completed another iteration to improve the prototype after the project was over.<br>
                              3. In terms of evaluation, I mainly contributed to the feedback sessions for wireframes and prototype. I worked as facilitator and notetaker.</p>

                                <b>1.User Research:</b><br>
                               - Firstly, we collected and aggregated feedback from iOS stores, students, student club leaders. We also analyzed the data on Apple's App Analytics.<br>
                               - We conducted semi-structured interviews with our classmates and friends and probed to understand what they expected from this app.<br>
                               - Then, we did competitive analysis and learnt from similar apps on the market<br>
                               - Fianlly, we aggregated all the notes and used spreadsheets to analyze them to get the findings. And we created personas and formed user requirements for the following design iterations.<br>
                               <br>

                               
                               <b>2.Desgin Iterations:</b><br>
                               - We started from the allocation of functions based on users' needs. Then we redesigned the information architecture according to the functions we decided to keep.<br>
                               - Then we explored the basic layout of the home screen and put forward different ideas. We evaluated them and picked one direction as a reference for the following design of wireframes and user flow of the whole app.<br>
                               - We created the wireframes and the basic user flow. We conducted internal reviews and tweaked them based on team members' feedback.<br>
                               <br>
                               - Next, we zoomed in on the hifi prototypes and finished one more round of iteration according to internal feedback.<br>
                               - Finally, we completed all the design of screens and user flow.<br>
                               - Unfortunately, due to the limit of time and skills we have, we didn't conduct usability tests in this project. We should have done some benchmarking tests to evaluate the usability or accessibility of our app and had one more iteration.<br>
                               <br>

                               <b>3.Development:</b><br>
                               - We export all the assets and specs and collaborated with iOS developers to actualize the design as accurate as possible.<br>
                               - After the devlopment, we shipped it to the iOS store in April 2017. We also carried out promotion within the university and introduced the new version of Tong Qu.<br>
                               - Finally, we used quantative from App Analytics and qualitative data from iOS store reviews to evaluate the impact of this update.

                               1. Understood and empathized better with our target user groups: newly graduated students who had little experience in furnishing and buying furniture.<br>
                               2. Learnt about the entire process within which users made furnishing plans and bought furniture.<br>
                               3. Discovered significant issues and design opportunities and selected the problem space we focused on in the following work.<br>

We observed the spatial layout of the store, the shelves for all the furniture or related products and how users interacted with the environment. This method could help us discover some existing pain points or space to improve in brick and mortar stores.

                          <span style="font-weight: 600;">
                          - The Home Depot's business was not focused on our target users. They focused more on contractors, builders, interior desingers and DIY customers who have big houses rather than small apartments.<br>
                          - Delivery was inconvenient, especially for people who didn't have cars. Delivery services were quite expensive.<br>
                          - Returns were inevitable now because users wouldn't know how items fit into their homes until they brought them back.<br>
                          - People enjoy seeing and touching furniture by themselves to be confident in their purchase.<br>
                          - Though Ikea's self-pickup system is complete, some people still get confused and need help from staff.</span></p>

                          <p class = "project-desc">We used Google Forms to create our survey and distributed it on different colleges' subreddits. In the survey, we included questions collecting demographic data and participants' general opinions and preferences during the furnishing and purchase process.</p>
                          <p class = "project-desc"><span style="font-weight: 600;"> Out of 86 responses we got from the survey, we observed some general preferences:<br>
                          -People often collect information and make furnishing plans online.<br>
                          -Most of users accept second-hand furniture as an option.<br>
                          -Price, aesthetic, size and material are the 4 most important factors influencing user's choice of furniture.<br>
                          -More than half of the participants transport furniture using personal vehicles.</span> </p>

We conducted 4 semi-structured interviews with our target users to ask about their furnishing and purchase experiences. When they were answering our questions, We kept probing whys behind their behavior based on their answers. </p>
                          <p class = "project-desc"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Some important insights we found through the interviews included:<br>
                          -Measuring the dimensions of apartments was unfamiliar to users and may lead to anxiety and frustration.<br>
                          -Making furnishing plans, especially creating one with a unified visual style, was hard to users if they hadn't received any design, art or related training before.<br>
                          -When users started to work, their time is limited for doing research on the furnishing. So they had to finish this process in a limited amount of time to settle themselves down.</span></p>

                          <p class = "project-desc"><span style="font-weight: 600;">We were able to know more about the existing solutions on the market to help ourselves avoid focusing on problems or pain points which had already been well solved. For example, there were too many solutions for solving the problem of transporting furniture, whether innovative or conservative, indicating that it was not very promising for us to make more efforts for this problem.</span></p>
